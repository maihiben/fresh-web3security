### ✅ **Comprehensive Design Rules for AI Agent: Web3Security Project**

> Please follow these detailed rules to design a **futuristic**, **dark-themed**, and **responsive** interface for a Web3 security project named **Web3Security**. The goal is to create an experience that feels trustworthy, cutting-edge, and sleek — inspired by Web3 design trends, cyberpunk vibes, and high-end user interfaces.

---

#### 🎨 1. **Theme and Aesthetic**

* Use a **dark theme** as the base.
* Use deep blacks (`#0D0D0D`, `#111111`) and layered grays for the background.
* Use **neon/glow accents**: electric blue, cyber purple, acid green, glowing orange, etc. (e.g., `#00FFFF`, `#FF00FF`, `#39FF14`)
* Accent borders or highlights should have soft glows using Tailwind’s `shadow`, `ring`, and `backdrop-blur`.

---

#### 🧊 2. **Glassmorphism Effects**

* Apply **glass-like cards** or sections with:

  * `backdrop-blur-md` or higher
  * `bg-white/5` or `bg-gray-100/5`
  * `border border-white/10` or `border border-gray-100/10`
  * Soft inner shadows or outer glows
* Use this for containers like feature cards, modals, and side panels.

---

#### 📱 3. **Mobile Responsiveness**

* Use **Tailwind’s responsive utilities** (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) for all layout and typography
* Ensure proper spacing, stacking, and content flow on mobile
* Use **mobile-first design** practices
* Sticky/floating **Connect Wallet** button for mobile

---

#### 💡 4. **Typography**

* Use modern, clean, and slightly futuristic fonts (like **Inter**, **Space Grotesk**, or **Orbitron**)
* Headings: bold, uppercase or capitalized, spaced out
* Paragraphs: smaller, readable, muted-gray text (`text-gray-400`)
* Add letter spacing and `tracking-wide` to important labels or buttons

---

#### 🔲 5. **Layout**

* Use **grid and flex layouts** for structuring content
* Center important CTAs and hero content
* Cards should be spaced well and visually separated
* For sections: use `max-w-screen-xl`, `px-6 md:px-12 lg:px-24`

---

#### 🧩 6. **UI Components Must Be**

* **Rounded** (`rounded-2xl`, `rounded-lg`)
* **Soft glowing borders or hover effects**
* Include **motion effects** like hover transitions or subtle animations
* Responsive navigation bar with hamburger on mobile
* Use **icons** from `lucide-react` or animated SVGs for interactivity

---

#### 🖼️ 7. **Animations and Interactions**

* Animate hover states of buttons and cards using `transition-all`, `duration-300`, `ease-in-out`
* Use **Framer Motion** for animated entry of sections or elements
* CTA buttons should scale slightly on hover and glow
* Glass elements should **reflect mouse movement subtly** (optional)

---

#### 🔌 8. **Integrations (Placeholder Components for Now)**

* Use a placeholder `Connect Wallet` button with glowing effects
* Placeholders for features: Wallet Analyzer, Token Scanner, etc.
* Sidebar/drawer UI for mobile navigation
* Modal popup with blur + fade animations for actions

---

#### 🛠️ 9. **Reusable Components**

* Design with reusability in mind:

  * `GlassCard`
  * `SectionWrapper`
  * `FeatureCard`
  * `Header`
  * `Footer`
* Style each component with clean Tailwind utility classes

---

#### 🌐 10. **Inspiration Sources**

Design should be inspired by:

* **Apple-style glassmorphism**
* **Cyberpunk interfaces**
* **Web3 UIs** like Zapper, Chainlink, Rainbow, Phantom Wallet
* Sci-fi dashboards or terminal UIs (but polished, not cluttered)

---

#### 🧼 11. **Performance & Clean Code**

* Use semantic HTML (`section`, `article`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`)
* Maintain accessible color contrast
* Avoid heavy dependencies unless needed (prefer Tailwind + Framer Motion)

---

### ✅ Final Note:

Every screen/page (starting from the homepage) must **follow these design principles** strictly. Prioritize **visual clarity**, **user trust**, and a **futuristic yet usable experience**.
