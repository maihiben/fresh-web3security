You can test your Smart Contract Scanner with **any deployed smart contract address** on a supported EVM chain (Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, etc.). Here are some good options:

---

## 1. **Popular, Safe Contracts (for “safe” results)**

- **USDT (Tether, Ethereum Mainnet):**
  ```
  0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7
  ```
- **USDC (Ethereum Mainnet):**
  ```
  0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48
  ```
- **Uniswap V2 Router:**
  ```
  0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D
  ```

---

## 2. **Contracts with Known Issues (for “risky” results)**

- **TheDAO (hacked contract, Ethereum):**
  ```
  0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413
  ```
- **Parity Multisig Wallet (hacked, Ethereum):**
  ```
  0x863df6bfa4469f3ead0be8f9f2aae51c91a907b4
  ```

---

## 3. **Random/Unknown Contracts**

- You can use any contract address from Etherscan, BscScan, etc.  
  Example: Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/contracts), pick any contract, and copy its address.

---

## 4. **How to Use**

- Paste the address into your scanner.
- Make sure your wallet is connected to the correct chain (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet for the above).
- Click “Scan Contract”.

## 5. **Where to Find More**

- **Etherscan:** https://etherscan.io/contracts
- **BscScan:** https://bscscan.com/contracts
- **PolygonScan:** https://polygonscan.com/contracts

**Tip:**  
If you want to see a “risky” result, try contracts with known exploits or those flagged on Forta/GoPlus.  
If you want to see a “safe” result, use blue-chip tokens like USDT, USDC, or Uniswap.
